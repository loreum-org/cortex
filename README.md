# 🌐 **Loreum: A Decentralized Intelligence Network**

## **Overview**

**Loreum** is a decentralized, AI-driven network designed for **distributed inference, agent collaboration, and real-time decision-making**. By integrating **DAG-based Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and a **peer-to-peer reputation mechanism**, Loreum enables **scalable, trustless AI processing** across an autonomous ecosystem.

## **📌 Key Features**

✅ **DAG-Based aBFT Consensus** – High-throughput, leaderless finality for trustless computations.  
✅ **Peer-to-Peer Network** – Nodes communicate using **libp2p**, ensuring censorship resistance.  
✅ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Enables **context-aware decision-making** with real-time data.  
✅ **Agent-Driven Execution** – Modular agents perform **AI reasoning, governance, and data processing**.  
✅ **Decentralized Reputation System** – Secure, **stake-weighted incentives** prevent Sybil attacks.  
✅ **Loreum Cortex** – The brain of the network, integrating agents, queries, and transactions.  
✅ **Tokenized Economy** – Uses the **$LORE token** for staking, query monetization, and governance.

## **📜 Architecture Overview**

Loreum consists of **three core layers** that work together to create a **secure, modular, and intelligent decentralized network**.

### **1️⃣ The Sensor Hub**
- Connects to **real-time data sources** (blockchain oracles, APIs, IoT sensors).
- Converts raw inputs into structured embeddings for **LLM inference**.
- Provides **historical and real-time context** for decision-making.

### **2️⃣ The Agent Hub**
- Hosts **autonomous agents** that respond to queries and execute smart contracts.
- Implements a **distributed RAG system** for **multi-node inference and learning**.
- Manages **fine-tuned AI models** and decentralized applications (dApps).

### **3️⃣ The Loreum Cortex (Computation Layer)**
- Implements **DAG-based aBFT consensus** for **high-speed inference validation**.
- Uses **libp2p P2P networking** to propagate **queries and responses**.
- Integrates a **local vector database** for knowledge retrieval.
- **Finalizes computations** using reputation-based decision aggregation.

## **🛠️ How It Works**

1. **Query Routing**: A user submits a question or task, which is **distributed across the network**.  
2. **Node Specialization**: The request is **matched to nodes** with relevant **sensors & agents**.  
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: Nodes run **DAG-aBFT** to agree on results **without a leader**.  
4. **Finalized Response**: The best-ranked nodes produce a **verified, reputation-weighted answer**.  
5. **Economic Incentives**: Nodes earn **$LORE rewards** based on **accuracy, speed, and trust score**.
